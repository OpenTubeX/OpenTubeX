<!-- release-note:start -->

<!-- The release notes normalize the markup and limit images taller than 300 pixels. -->
<!-- Agent instructions:
For a noteworthy visible change, add media when it makes the change easier to understand. Prefer a still image unless motion is the point. Recordings in this section must end up as animated WebP because release notes accept images, not video attachments.
After implementing a visible change, proactively capture the result and show the local media to the user for approval before uploading it or updating the pull request.
When the affected UI differs between dark and light themes, capturing both themes is required. A dark-only image is incomplete. The final pull request body must combine the hosted URLs into a theme-aware `<picture>` with dark and light `prefers-color-scheme` sources and the dark image as its `<img>` fallback. Never leave the two theme captures as separate images. Use a single default-dark capture only when the light theme cannot be captured or looks identical.
Capture or crop to the smallest region that still makes the change clear. Do not include the full window when the affected component can be understood on its own.
Use English unless localization is the subject. Keep components at their normal dimensions and placement instead of resizing them to fill the frame.
Use deterministic local fixtures for visible remote images. Reusable avatar and thumbnail fixtures are available through `e2e/helpers/visual-fixtures.mjs`. Before capturing, verify that every visible image has loaded successfully (`complete === true` and `naturalWidth > 0`).
Inspect the final dark and light files for failed images, missing content, unrelated UI, awkward animation, and misleading layout. Omit media when it does not explain the change clearly.
Use GitHub CLI 2.99.0 or newer to upload images no larger than 10 MB. For one image, write an ordinary Markdown image reference to the local file between the marker comments. Pass the same file to `gh pr create` or `gh pr edit` with `--attach <path>` so GitHub CLI replaces the local path with its hosted URL.
GitHub CLI does not rewrite paths inside HTML attributes. For themed images within its size limit, first upload both files through temporary Markdown image references and repeat `--attach <path>` for each one. Read back the hosted URLs, replace the temporary references with the `<picture>` below, and update the pull request body without `--attach`:
<picture>
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="HOSTED_DARK_URL">
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" srcset="HOSTED_LIGHT_URL">
  <img alt="DESCRIPTION" src="HOSTED_DARK_URL">
</picture>
For every MP4, MOV, or WebM recording, use `node _scripts/releaseNoteMedia.mjs FILE --alt "DESCRIPTION"` regardless of file size so the helper converts it to animated WebP. Use the same command when an image exceeds 10 MB. For a themed pair where either file needs the helper, use `node _scripts/releaseNoteMedia.mjs --dark DARK_FILE --light LIGHT_FILE --alt "DESCRIPTION"`. Paste only its generated markup between the marker comments.
Check for personal information, tokens, private repository names, and unrelated desktop content before uploading. Uploaded media is public.
Keep capture-only scripts, test hooks, screenshots, and recordings out of commits. Remove them before committing unless the capture code is also a reusable regression test. Never commit generated release-note media.
Leave this section empty when media would not help.
